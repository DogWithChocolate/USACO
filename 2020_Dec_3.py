# have the program based on which cows intercept and which don't. the ones that don't will go on infinitley.
# If intercepting, then that means that the cow facing north will be to the bottom right or the one facing the east(, while the one facing the east would be to the top left of the cow facing north)
# you also have to consider the times when the cow facing north is underneath the cow facing east, or when the cow facing east is right to the left of the cow facing north.
